# Sorting with the Strategy Pattern

In this exercise, we want to implement sorting algorithms and choose them based on runtime specific variables.

### Part 1: Sorting

First, we need to implement two sorting algorithms, in this case `MergeSort` and `BubbleSort`.

**You have the following tasks:**

1. [task][Implement Bubble Sort](testBubbleSort)
Implement the method `perform_sort()` in the class `BubbleSort`. Make sure to follow the Bubble Sort algorithm exactly.
